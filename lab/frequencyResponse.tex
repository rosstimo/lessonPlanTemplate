\label{sec:Part3}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Demonstrate the ability to accurately identify and represent amplifier frequency response characteristics and important values.
    \item Describe graphically and in writing how coupling and bypass capacitors affect amplifier frequency response.
    \item Demonstrate the ability to accurately represent amplifier frequency response in a Bode Plot.
    \item Demonstrate the ability to accurately analyze, predict and measure the frequency response of an amplifier circuit.
    \item Define in writing key terms including but not limited to: Critical frequency, Bode Plot, Decibel, Attenuation, Roll Off.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Figures/Tables}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Include $R_{\text{th}}$ redraw for each capacitor in proper context with calculations. \label{fig:RthRedraw}
    \item Include Thevenin equivalent circuit for each capacitor in proper context with calculations. \label{fig:TheveninEquivalent}
    \item The frequency response bode plot will be the primary representation of circuit operation for this section. \label{fig:BodePlot}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Calculations}
\label{sec:Calculations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use the $R_{\text{th}}$ redraw and Thevenin equivalent for each capacitor to find each capacitor's critical frequency.
    \item Use the formula $f_{\text{c}} = \sqrt{f_{\text{c1}}^2 + f_{\text{c2}}^2 + f_{\text{c3}}^2}$ to determine the combined effects of all the capacitors on the amplifier circuit's low-end frequency response.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Measurements}
\label{sec:Measurements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe in writing the measurement process for the predicted values of the circuit. Include drawings and diagrams where appropriate.
    \item Sweep the frequency down below the predicted lower critical frequency then adjust the frequency up while watching the amplitude of $v_{\text{out}}$.
    \item The $v_{\text{out}}$ amplitude should increase as frequency goes up then decrease as the upper critical frequency is approached.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Waveforms/Diagrams}
\label{sec:Waveforms}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a properly scaled measured bode plot (big and readable).
    \item Measure $v_{\text{out}}$ at each frequency shown in the given Bode plot graph below.
    \item Calculate the attenuation in dB referenced to measured $v_{\text{out}}$ at $f_{\text{mid}}$ and plot the data point.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Present your completed write-up to your instructor. Be prepared to demonstrate circuit operation.
\end{enumerate}
