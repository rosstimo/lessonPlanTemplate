\subsubsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Demonstrate the ability to accurately identify swamping resistors.
    \item Describe graphically and in writing how and why the resistors of $R_{\text{E}}$ are fully, partially, and not bypassed.
    \item Demonstrate the ability to accurately represent the AC/DC load line for the circuit as $R_{\text{E}}$ changes values.
    \item Demonstrate the ability to accurately analyze, predict, and measure $A_{\text{V}}$ and any other values affected by the swamping resistor.
    \item Define in writing key terms including but not limited to: swamping, bypass, etc.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Figures/Tables}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Refer to Figure 3-1 Universal Biased Common Emitter Amplifier.
    \item Include the schematic figure, tables and load line together for ease of review and comparison.
    \item The $A_{\text{v}}$ waveform measurements will be the primary representation of circuit operation for this section.
\end{enumerate}
